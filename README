Net::Milter version 0.01
================================

DESCRIPTION

This is a pure Perl implementation of the Sendmail end of the milter API. The
goal is to provide an interface by which milter filters can be easily queried
by programs other than Sendmail.

This implementation of milter is developed from the description provided
by Todd Vierling,
www.duh.org/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout/pmilter/doc/milter-protocol.txt?rev=1
and from examining the tcp output from Sendmail.
The official milter documentation can be found at :
www.sendmail.com/partner/resources/development/milter_api/design.html

The file scripts/test_sim.pl is an example of connecting to a milter filter
and passing information about an email.
